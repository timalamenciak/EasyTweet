Introduction
============

This script simply sends a tweet. It's designed for low-bandwidth applications, where you don't even have enough of a connection to check Twitter. It works well for spotty connections like satellite uplinks.

Usage
=====

Command line:

  python tweet.py This is my tweet.

Simple.

Installation
============

Install dependencies:
- python-twitter
  - httplib
  - simplegeo-python-oauth2
  - simplejson

Party.

Future
======

It'd be nice to have the script wait for input, so that you could fire it up and just blast off multiple tweets.
